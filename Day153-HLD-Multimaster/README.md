Notes for today's class on Typeahead

Hey folks, we are preparing interview docs for company+role combination to help you be better prepared before interviews (directionally).  
We prepared a sample doc for Uber, SDE2 at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mZf5rppZ928Kn5s48SknbVOrwCagQ8l3PHYMMGOEA5Q/edit#

Could you let us know your feedback on the doc? If everything looks good, we will get started on other companies+role combinations as well. This is a slow process, so you may not see all companies/role combinations ready immediately. But we will slowly get there.
